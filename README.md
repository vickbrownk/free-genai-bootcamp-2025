## 🚀 Bootcamp Overview
The **GenAI Bootcamp 2025** is designed to help participants:

✅ Understand the **capabilities & limitations** of GenAI  
✅ Apply GenAI to **real-world business cases** through projects  
✅ Learn to **architect & deploy** GenAI workloads effectively  

Each week increases in difficulty, demanding **problem-solving** and **adaptability**. Many participants may drop out, but I plan to **push through and complete all challenges**.

## 💼 Business Scenario
In this simulated bootcamp challenge, I’ve been hired as an **AI Engineer** for a **Korean Hagwon (Language Learning Center)** to:

- Develop **AI-powered learning applications** for language learning
- Enhance **student engagement** beyond instructor-led classes
- Utilize **AI for personalized English-Korean language practice**

Many students struggle with real-world **English fluency** due to a lack of **interactive, personalized practice**. These **AI-powered applications** aim to bridge that gap.

## 🎯 My Approach to the Bootcamp
To stay on track and maximize learning, I’ll be following this mindset:

✔ **Structured Learning** – Active participation in every session, Q&A, and discussions.  
✔ **Time Management** – Dedicated study & coding time each week.  
✔ **Collaboration** – Engaging with other participants, sharing insights.  
✔ **Problem-Solving First** – Debugging & troubleshooting before asking for help.  
✔ **Consistency Over Perfection** – Finishing tasks rather than waiting for the perfect solution.
