GenAI Bootcamp 2025
This repository documents my journey through the GenAI Bootcamp 2025 organized by Andrew Brown. I’ll be designing and developing AI-powered learning applications, focusing on real-world GenAI solutions, model selection, prompt engineering, and cloud deployment.

Bootcamp Overview
The GenAI Bootcamp 2025 is designed to help participants:

Understand the capabilities & limitations of GenAI.
Apply GenAI to real-world business cases through projects.
Learn to architect & deploy GenAI workloads effectively.
Each week, the difficulty level increases, requiring strong problem-solving and adaptability. Many participants may drop out, but I plan to push through and complete all challenges.

Business Scenario
I've been hired as an AI Engineer for a Korean Hagwon (Language Learning Center) to:

Expand language learning through AI-powered applications.
Enhance student engagement between instructor-led classes.
Leverage AI for personalized English-Korean language practice.
Many students struggle with real-world English fluency due to a lack of interactive, personalized practice. These AI-powered apps aim to bridge that gap.

Planned Learning Applications
Daily Life Visual Novel Generator: A town-based learning app where users engage in daily routine conversations with variation.
Korean Text Adventure: A story-driven language learning game that gradually introduces vocabulary and grammar.
English-Korean Sentence Constructor: Helps users translate English sentences into Korean through guided AI feedback.
Sign to Speak: A KSL (Korean Sign Language) learning app that uses a webcam to recognize fingerspelling.
Subtitles to Vocabulary: Extracts new vocabulary words from movie subtitle files for efficient learning.
Speech to Learn: Provides real-time feedback on pronunciation and fluency in a target language.

My Approach to the Bootcamp
To stay on track and maximize learning, I’ll be following this mindset:

Structured Learning – Active participation in every session, Q&A, and discussions.
Time Management – Dedicated study & coding time each week.
Collaboration – Engaging with other participants, sharing insights.
Problem-Solving First – Debugging & troubleshooting before asking for help.
Consistency Over Perfection – Finishing tasks rather than waiting for the perfect solution.
